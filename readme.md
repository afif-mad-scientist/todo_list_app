## **My first app with React-Native**
it is a Todo List app, in which you can add tasks and delete them


### **How to use the repository**
due to the huge storage space that the app files took (~100mb ;p) i've just uploaded just the files i edited.
so if you wanna use the repository you need just to: 
- creat a new app on your computer
- copy and past on it these files
